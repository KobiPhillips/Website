        <h2>Your local, reliable yardworkers</h2>
        <p>Proudly born and raised in the area, me and my crew would be more
            than glad to help out with your needs. But why take a risk with random kids
            instead of those big coorporate companies? Simple. We are the ones who care.
            Our buisness depends on good, hard, honest work, while they will thrive no matter what.
            Check out what we can do for you at <a href="Services.html"> Services</a> our past work
            in our<a href="Gallery.html"> gallery</a>, and if all looks good, head
            to <a href="Booking.html"> Booking</a> to book our services</p>
